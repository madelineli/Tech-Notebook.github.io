Tom Preston-Werner, the co-founder of GitHub who had since moved on to a new adventure had written a blog post on <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/03/29/ten-lessons-from-githubs-first-year.html">Ten Lessons from GitHub's First Year.</a> Of the ten things he listed, I found the following most useful when comes to experimenting with new technology and prototyping new thing.

I often find myself thinking too hard on how to build something new from scratch and to make it clever and impressive. But thinking along that vein always gets me in trouble with meeting the deadline, because I would grossly under-estimate how much time I need to prove that something works. 

__JUST GET IT WORKING, NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES!__ Then refine it.
