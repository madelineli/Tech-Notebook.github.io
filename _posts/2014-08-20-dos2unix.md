Remember the __dos2unix__ command? You are made to run that command whenever you deal with shell scripts that were created and maintaiened in a Windows environment, but have to be run on a Unix or Linux box during installation, or patch time. It always makes me wonder why I am still dealing with Windows..

I recently had to develop a patch to migrate data from one data source to another. I ran into the same old carriage return/line feed issue when I tried to run a shell script I created on my Windows box on the linux integration box. Enter Maven. Its assembly plugin has an option for converting the carriage return/linefeed for Windows to unix/linux for a given file set. All you need to do is add the \<lineEnding\>unix\</lineEnding\> to the assmebly's config as the following demonstrates:

    <assembly xmslns="https://maven.apache.org./plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1,1,2"
              xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
              xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/assembly/1.1.2 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/assembly-1.1.2.xsd">

        <id>bin</id>
        <formats>
            <format>zip</format>
            <format>tar.gz</format>
        </formats>
        <fileSets>
            <fileSet>
                <directory>src/scripts</directory>
                <outputDirectory></outputDirectory>
                <includes>
                    <include>*.sh</include>
                </includes>
                <lineEnding>unix</lineEnding>
            </fileSet>             
        </fiseSets>
    </assembly>
